        <h1 class="display-4">Small Magellanic Cloud</h1>
        <p class="lead">The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), or Nubecula Minor,
          is a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way. At a distance of about 200,000 light-years,
          it is one of the Milky Way's nearest intergalactic neighbors.</p>
        <p class="lead">It has a diameter of about 7,000 light-years, contains several hundred million stars,
           and has a total mass of approximately 7 billion times the mass of the Sun.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
           The SMC contains a central bar structure and it is speculated that it was once
           a barred spiral galaxy that was disrupted by the Milky Way to become somewhat irregular.
        </p>

        <div class="pic-container">
          <p class="visibility-note">
            The SMC is mostly visible from the Southern Hemisphere though it can be fully glimpsed
            from near the southern horizon from equatorial latitudes south of about 15° N.
            It is located across both the constellations of Tucana and part of Hydrus,
            appearing as a hazy light patch resembling a detached piece of the Milky Way.
            It covers an average diameter of about 4.2° across (8 times the Moon's diameter)
            or 51.7 sq. degrees (about 60 times the apparent area of the Moon.)
            Since it has a very low surface brightness, the SMC is best seen from a dark site
            away from city lights. It forms a pair with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),
            which lies a further 20° to the east, and like the LMC, is a member of the Local Group
            and highly probably is a satellite of the Milky Way.
